# CardTuber: Animated Avatar On a Business Card.

People who post videos on YouTube are called YouTubers.
YouTubers who use animated avatars are known as V-Tubers.
V-Tubers who use only four PNG images as their avatars are called PNGTubers.
But what about people who use animated avatars in real life?

Introducing the CardTuber: an animated avatar on a business card.

## The Story

Let's rewind a bit to the beginning.
First, the earth cooled. Then came CircuitPython.
I created an online IDE for CircuitPython called the "Circuit Python Online IDE" and consider myself a maker.
I demonstrated it at the Philadelphia Maker Faire in 2022
and the Long Island Maker Faire in 2023.
I was also planning to attend the Long Island Maker Faire in 2024.
One thing I always wanted for the Maker Faire is a maker badge,
like the fun and powerful one from Supercon.
So, I decided to make one for this year.

While thinking about how to design a maker badge,
I came across a Business Card Contest on Hackaday.
I realized that this was the perfect form factor for a badge:
- Business card size
- Introduces myself
- Does something cool

## The design

Of course, this is a business card and a badge,
so on the right side it has my name on it,
along with a brief introduction about myself.

On the left side, people typically include a logo or photo of their business.
I could use my YouTube avatar, but that feels too boring.
In one of my recent videos, I created an animated avatar by drawing four PNG images
(inspired by the character Izutsumi in Dungeon Meshi.)
I think it would be a great idea to use that avatar here.

Since this is a maker badge for the LI Maker Faire,
I wanted to incorporate elements related to it.
The lighthouse in the LI Maker Faire logo is an actual lighthouse in Montauk.
As a Long Islander, Iâ€™ve visited it several times and really like it.
So, I found a good photo of the lighthouse on the MTA's website and drew a sketch of it.

## The hardware

Because the avatar needs to talk when I talk,
I need a MIC module to capture the sound.
This makes the Seeed Xiao the perfect choice as the microcontroller board.
Despite its small size, it includes:
- A powerful computing unit
- A MIC
- A battery management circuit
- (It also has an accelerometer and BLE, which I didn't use for this project.)

The screen I choose is Sharp.
I mean it is really Sharp (bad pun)....
These Sharp Memory LCD are not only power-efficient but also offer excellent image quality.

The Adafruit Sharp Memory LCD module is used here.
I used a technique I call "back mounting" to attach the module to the PCB.
In back mounting, a hole is made in the PCB for the screen to be visible from the front,
while the rest of the module is hidden behind the PCB.
There is also a cutout for the cable.
The module has four screw holes,
but instead of screwing the module onto the PCB,
I soldered them together.
This way, the module is "stamped" onto the PCB without significantly increasing the thickness,
and it looks clean from the front.

If I tell you that this array of resistors is all 1M ohm,
you probably know they are used for capacitive touch.
Yes, the entire right side of the business card is a linear touchpad.
When making capacitive touch PCBs,
I usually hide all the traces on the back of the PCB,
leaving only the touchpads on the front.
And this one is no exception.

There are two battery connectors.
A coin cell battery is used to keep the business card thin,
but if longer battery life is needed,
a LiPo battery can be connected.
The Xiao NRF52840 board is in charge of the batteries (bad pun again).

## The Software

The code is written in CircuitPython,
not only because I am the author of CircuitPython Online IDE,
but also because it has excellent support for NRF52840 microcontrollers, MICs, capacitive touch, and Sharp memory displays.

### Blink and Speak

The mechanism is very similar to that of a PNGTuber.
Basically, I have four images representing the combinations of mouth open/closed and eyes open/closed.
The system selects one of the images based on the current status of the eyes and mouth.

The avatar blinks randomly every 2 to 5 seconds,
achieved with a timer set to a random duration.

The avatar speaks when the volume picked up by the MIC exceeds a certain threshold.
When speaking, the avatar rises slightly and returns to its original position when it stops,
which gives a more lively appearance.

The volume is measured as the logarithm of the sound wave's amplitude.
The threshold is just a number.
However, the Maker Faire is a very busy environment,
so I can't rely on a fixed threshold level due to the unpredictable background noise.
Instead, I implemented an adaptive algorithm:
The volume levels within a sliding time window are stored in the microcontroller
and set the threshold to be slightly above the minimum volume within that window.
This adaptive threshold worked very well.

### QR code

The CardTuber should function as a business card, providing contact information.
Even though there's a lot written on the card,
I still wanted to present it in a fancier way.
When people ask me about my social media or GitHub,
I can swipe up on the text to reveal a QR code.
Remember, this whole area is a touchpad!

## The show

Even though there are holes designed for a lanyard,
I wanted to wear this as a maker badge together with the badge of the LI Maker Faire.
So, I 3D-printed a case for the badge,
which can be attached to the Maker Faire badge with a twist tie.
The case also has holes to ensure the MIC is not blocked.

Here is how it looked on Maker Faire day!

## The bonus

And of course, how can such a thing be complete without games?
