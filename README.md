# CardTuber

CardTuber is an electronic business card featuring an animated avatar. It also doubles as a maker badge for the Long Island Maker Faire. There is a MIC that picks up the surrounding volume, so when I wear it, the avatar speaks when I speak. The text area is also a touchpad. A QR code for my socials can be brought up by swiping on it.
